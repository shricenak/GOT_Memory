This is a homeowrk assignment from my Java 2 course I took in my freshman year of college.
It's a version of the classic Memory game, where all the tiles are characters from the popular HBO series "Game of Thrones."

The original version had three songs from the show, but I've decided to remove them for copyright purposes.

This was uploaded merely for showcase purposes, and I do not intend on expanding on it.

This was put up to showcase my code (which I have no plans on expanding on) but I did include the .jar file and a batch file to run it.

To start this program, simply double click the "Game of Thrones Memory" batch file.
